## The Memory Hierarchy

- Random-Access Memory (RAM)

  - Key feature

    - **_RAM_** is traditionally packaged as a chip.
    - Basic storage unit is normally a cell (one bit per cell.)
    - Multiple RAM chips from a memory

  - RAM comes in two varieties:
    - SRAM(Static RAM)
    - DRAM(Dynamic RAM)

- Nonvolatile Memories
  - DRAM and SRAM are volatile memories
    - Lose information if powered off.
  - Nonvolatile memories retain value even if powered off
    - Read-only memory(ROM)
      - programmed during prouction.
    - Programmable ROM(PROM)
      - can be programmed once
    - Eraseable PROM(EPROM)
      - can be buld erased (UV, X-Ray)
    - Flash memory
      - with partial(block-level) erase capability
        - Wears out after about 100000 erasings
  - Uses for Nonvolatile Memories
    - Firmware programs stored in a ROM ( BIOS, controllers for disks, network cards, graphics accelerators, security subsystems, ...)
    - Solid state disks (replace rotating disks in thumb drives smart phone, mp3 players, tablets, laptops,...)
    - Disk caches.
