- Bus: is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols
- Direct memory access (DMA): is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory (random-access memory) independently of the central processing unit (CPU).
